#HaxeFlixel API Docs

With Haxe installed in your command line navigate your cwd to ./flixel/docs/targets and run ```nekotools server```, you can now open localhost:2000 in a browser and view.

----

Note to regenerate docs it depends on Dox which currently requires Haxe compiled from the development branch. For more infor https://github.com/dpeek/dox. Currently ths documentation has a workaround for the menu due to the non standard use of UInt in openfl https://github.com/dpeek/dox/issues/22. Any help to use dox like api.haxe.org would be appreciated.
