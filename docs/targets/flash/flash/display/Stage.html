<em>
</em> <p>For SWF content running in the browser(in Flash<sup>Â®</sup> Player),
<em> the Stage represents the entire area where Flash content is shown. For
</em> content running in AIR on desktop operating systems, each NativeWindow
<em> object has a corresponding Stage object.</p>
</em>
<em> <p>The Stage object is not globally accessible. You need to access it
</em> through the <code>stage</code> property of a DisplayObject instance.</p>
<em>
</em> <p>The Stage class has several ancestor classes  -  DisplayObjectContainer,
<em> InteractiveObject, DisplayObject, and EventDispatcher  -  from which it
</em> inherits properties and methods. Many of these properties and methods are
<em> either inapplicable to Stage objects, or require security checks when
</em> called on a Stage object. The properties and methods that require security
<em> checks are documented as part of the Stage class.</p>
</em>
<em> <p>In addition, the following inherited properties are inapplicable to
</em> Stage objects. If you try to set them, an IllegalOperationError is thrown.
<em> These properties may always be read, but since they cannot be set, they
</em> will always contain default values.</p>
<em>
</em> <ul>
<em>   <li><code>accessibilityProperties</code></li>
</em>   <li><code>alpha</code></li>

<em>
</em> <p>Some events that you might expect to be a part of the Stage class, such
<em> as <code>enterFrame</code>, <code>exitFrame</code>,
</em> <code>frameConstructed</code>, and <code>render</code>, cannot be Stage
<em> events because a reference to the Stage object cannot be guaranteed to
</em> exist in every situation where these events are used. Because these events
<em> cannot be dispatched by the Stage object, they are instead dispatched by
</em> every DisplayObject instance, which means that you can add an event
<em> listener to any DisplayObject instance to listen for these events. These
</em> events, which are part of the DisplayObject class, are called broadcast
<em> events to differentiate them from events that target a specific
</em> DisplayObject instance. Two other broadcast events, <code>activate</code>
<em> and <code>deactivate</code>, belong to DisplayObject's superclass,
</em> EventDispatcher. The <code>activate</code> and <code>deactivate</code>
<em> events behave similarly to the DisplayObject broadcast events, except that
</em> these two events are dispatched not only by all DisplayObject instances,
<em> but also by all EventDispatcher instances and instances of other
</em> EventDispatcher subclasses. For more information on broadcast events, see
<em> the DisplayObject class.</p>

<p>In general, the benefits of activating color management include
predictable and consistent color, better conversion, accurate proofing and
more efficient cross-media output. Be aware, though, that color management
does not provide perfect conversions due to devices having a different
gamut from each other or original images. Nor does color management
eliminate the need for custom or edited profiles. Color profiles are
dependent on browsers, operating systems(OS), OS extensions, output
devices, and application support.</p>

profiles. Use the <code>Stage.colorCorrectionSupport</code> property to

<em>
</em> <p>You can use only a limited number of StageVideo objects at a time. When
<em> a SWF begins to run, the number of available StageVideo objects depends on
</em> the platform and on available hardware. </p>
<em>
</em> <p>To use a StageVideo object, assign a member of the
<em> <code>stageVideos</code> Vector object to a StageVideo variable. </p>
</em>
<em> <p>All StageVideo objects are displayed on the stage behind any display
</em> objects. The StageVideo objects are displayed on the stage in the order
<em> they appear in the <code>stageVideos</code> Vector object. For example, if
</em> the <code>stageVideos</code> Vector object contains three entries:</p>
<em>
</em> <ol>
<em>   <li>The StageVideo object in the 0 index of the <code>stageVideos</code>
</em> Vector object is displayed behind all StageVideo objects.</li>
<em>   <li>The StageVideo object at index 1 is displayed in front of the
</em> StageVideo object at index 0.</li>
<em>   <li>The StageVideo object at index 2 is displayed in front of the
</em> StageVideo object at index 1.</li>
<em> </ol>
</em>
<em> <p>Use the <code>StageVideo.depth</code> property to change this

The
<code>wmodeGPU</code> value is <code>true</code> <i>only</i> when all
three of the following conditions exist:
<em>
<p>
<ul>
<li>GPU compositing has been requested.</li>
<li>GPU compositing is available.</li>
<li>GPU compositing is in use.</li>
</ul>
</p>
</em>
<p>Specifically, the <code>wmodeGPU</code> property indicates one of the
following:</p>
<em>
<p>
<ol>
<li>GPU compositing has not been requested or is unavailable. In this
case, the <code>wmodeGPU</code> property value is <code>false</code>.</li>
<li>GPU compositing has been requested(if applicable and available),
but the environment is operating in "fallback mode"(not optimal
rendering) due to limitations of the content. In this case, the
<code>wmodeGPU</code> property value is <code>true</code>.</li>
<li>GPU compositing has been requested(if applicable and available),
and the environment is operating in the best mode. In this case, the
<code>wmodeGPU</code> property value is also <code>true</code>.</li>
</ol>
</p>
</em>
<p>In other words, the <code>wmodeGPU</code> property identifies the
capability and state of the rendering environment. For runtimes that do
not support GPU compositing, such as AIR 1.5.2, the value is always
<code>false</code>, because(as stated above) the value is
<code>true</code> only when GPU compositing has been requested, is
available, and is in use.</p>
<em>
<p>The <code>wmodeGPU</code> property is useful to determine, at runtime,
whether or not GPU compositing is in use. The value of
<code>wmodeGPU</code> indicates if your content is going to be scaled by
hardware, or not, so you can present graphics at the correct size. You can
also determine if you're rendering in a fast path or not, so that you can
adjust your content complexity accordingly.</p>
</em>
<p>For Flash Player in a browser, GPU compositing can be requested by the
value of <code>gpu</code> for the <code>wmode</code> HTML parameter in the
page hosting the SWF file. For other configurations, GPU compositing can
be requested in the header of a SWF file(set using SWF authoring
tools).</p>
<em>
<p>However, the <code>wmodeGPU</code> property does not identify the
current rendering performance. Even if GPU compositing is "in use" the
rendering process might not be operating in the best mode. To adjust your
content for optimal rendering, use a Flash runtime debugger version, and
set the <code>DisplayGPUBlendsetting</code> in your mm.cfg file.</p>
</em>
<p><b>Note:</b> This property is always <code>false</code> when referenced
from ActionScript that runs before the runtime performs its first
rendering pass. For example, if you examine <code>wmodeGPU</code> from a
script in Frame 1 of Adobe Flash Professional, and your SWF file is the
first SWF file loaded in a new instance of the runtime, then the
<code>wmodeGPU</code> value is <code>false</code>. To get an accurate
value, wait until at least one rendering pass has occurred. If you write
an event listener for the <code>exitFrame</code> event of any
<code>DisplayObject</code>, the <code>wmodeGPU</code> value at is the
correct value.</p></p></div></div><div class="platform platform-flash"><a name="invalidate"></a><h3><code><span class="keyword">function</span> <a href="#invalidate"><span class="identifier">invalidate</span></a>():<a class="type" href="/flash/Void.html">Void</a></code></h3><div class="doc"><p>Calling the <code>invalidate()</code> method signals Flash runtimes to
alert display objects on the next opportunity it has to render the display
list(for example, when the playhead advances to a new frame). After you
call the <code>invalidate()</code> method, when the display list is next
rendered, the Flash runtime sends a <code>render</code> event to each
display object that has registered to listen for the <code>render</code>
event. You must call the <code>invalidate()</code> method each time you
want the Flash runtime to send <code>render</code> events.
<em>
<p>The <code>render</code> event gives you an opportunity to make changes
to the display list immediately before it is actually rendered. This lets
you defer updates to the display list until the latest opportunity. This
can increase performance by eliminating unnecessary screen updates.</p>
</em>
<p>The <code>render</code> event is dispatched only to display objects
that are in the same security domain as the code that calls the
