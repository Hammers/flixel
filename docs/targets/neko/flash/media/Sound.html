The Sound class
<em> lets you create a Sound object, load and play an external MP3 file into
</em> that object, close the sound stream, and access data about the sound, such
<em> as information about the number of bytes in the stream and ID3 metadata.
</em> More detailed control of the sound is performed through the sound source
<em>  -  the SoundChannel or Microphone object for the sound  -  and through the
</em> properties in the SoundTransform class that control the output of the sound
<em> to the computer's speakers.
</em>
<em> <p>In Flash Player 10 and later and AIR 1.5 and later, you can also use
</em> this class to work with sound that is generated dynamically. In this case,
<em> the Sound object uses the function you assign to a <code>sampleData</code>
</em> event handler to poll for sound data. The sound is played as it is
<em> retrieved from a ByteArray object that you populate with sound data. You
</em> can use <code>Sound.extract()</code> to extract sound data from a Sound
<em> object, after which you can manipulate it before writing it back to the
</em> stream for playback.</p>
<em>
</em> <p>To control sounds that are embedded in a SWF file, use the properties in
<em> the SoundMixer class.</p>
</em>
<em> <p><b>Note</b>: The ActionScript 3.0 Sound API differs from ActionScript
</em> 2.0. In ActionScript 3.0, you cannot take sound objects and arrange them in
<em> a hierarchy to control their properties.</p>
</em>
<em> <p>When you use this class, consider the following security model: </p>
</em>
<em> <ul>
</em>   <li>Loading and playing a sound is not allowed if the calling file is in
<em> a network sandbox and the sound file to be loaded is local.</li>
</em>   <li>By default, loading and playing a sound is not allowed if the calling
<em> file is local and tries to load and play a remote sound. A user must grant
</em> explicit permission to allow this type of access.</li>
<em>   <li>Certain operations dealing with sound are restricted. The data in a
</em> loaded sound cannot be accessed by a file in a different domain unless you
<em> implement a cross-domain policy file. Sound-related APIs that fall under
</em> this restriction are <code>Sound.id3</code>,
<em> <code>SoundMixer.computeSpectrum()</code>,
</em> <code>SoundMixer.bufferTime</code>, and the <code>SoundTransform</code>
<em> class.</li>
</em> </ul>
<em>
</em> <p>However, in Adobe AIR, content in the <code>application</code> security
<em> sandbox(content installed with the AIR application) are not restricted by
</em> these security limitations.</p>

<em>
</em> <p>MP3 sound files can contain ID3 tags, which provide metadata about the
<em> file. If an MP3 sound that you load using the <code>Sound.load()</code>
</em> method contains ID3 tags, you can query these properties. Only ID3 tags
<em> that use the UTF-8 character set are supported.</p>
</em>
<em> <p>Flash Player 9 and later and AIR support ID3 2.0 tags, specifically 2.3
</em> and 2.4. The following tables list the standard ID3 2.0 tags and the type
<em> of content the tags represent. The <code>Sound.id3</code> property
</em> provides access to these tags through the format
<em> <code>my<em>sound.id3.COMM</code>, <code>my</em>sound.id3.TIME</code>, and so on.
</em> The first table describes tags that can be accessed either through the ID3
<em> 2.0 property name or the ActionScript property name. The second table
</em> describes ID3 tags that are supported but do not have predefined
<em> properties in ActionScript. </p>
</em>
<em> <p>When using this property, consider the Flash Player security model:</p>
</em>
<em> <ul>
</em>   <li>The <code>id3</code> property of a Sound object is always permitted
<em> for SWF files that are in the same security sandbox as the sound file. For
</em> files in other sandboxes, there are security checks.</li>
<em>   <li>When you load the sound, using the <code>load()</code> method of the
</em> Sound class, you can specify a <code>context</code> parameter, which is a
<em> SoundLoaderContext object. If you set the <code>checkPolicyFile</code>
</em> property of the SoundLoaderContext object to <code>true</code>, Flash
<em> Player checks for a URL policy file on the server from which the sound is
</em> loaded. If a policy file exists and permits access from the domain of the
<em> loading SWF file, then the file is allowed to access the <code>id3</code>
</em> property of the Sound object; otherwise it is not.</li>
<em> </ul>

<code>null</code>.
<em>
<p>When you first call <code>Sound.load()</code>, the <code>url</code>
property initially has a value of <code>null</code>, because the final URL
is not yet known. The <code>url</code> property will have a non-null value
as soon as an <code>open</code> event is dispatched from the Sound
object.</p>
</em>
<p>The <code>url</code> property contains the final, absolute URL from
which a sound was loaded. The value of <code>url</code> is usually the
same as the value passed to the <code>stream</code> parameter of
<code>Sound.load()</code>. However, if you passed a relative URL to
<code>Sound.load()</code> the value of the <code>url</code> property
represents the absolute URL. Additionally, if the original URL request is
redirected by an HTTP server, the value of the <code>url</code> property
reflects the final URL from which the sound file was actually downloaded.
This reporting of an absolute, final URL is equivalent to the behavior of
<code>LoaderInfo.url</code>.</p>

action, such as a mouse click or key press.</li>

server must provide a URL policy file that permits cross-domain
