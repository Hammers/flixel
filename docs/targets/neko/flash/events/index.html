<em> asynchronous operation to fail.
</em>
<em> <p>The ErrorEvent class defines only one type of <code>error</code> event:
</em> <code>ErrorEvent.ERROR</code>. The ErrorEvent class also serves as the base
<em> class for several other error event classes, including the AsyncErrorEvent,
</em> IOErrorEvent, SecurityErrorEvent, SQLErrorEvent, and UncaughtErrorEvent
<em> classes.</p></td></tr><tr><td width="200"><a href="/neko/flash/events/Event.html">Event</a></td><td><p>The Event class is used as the base class for the creation of Event
<em> objects, which are passed as parameters to event listeners when an event
</em> occurs.
<em>
</em> <p>The properties of the Event class carry basic information about an
<em> event, such as the event's type or whether the event's default behavior can
</em> be canceled. For many events, such as the events represented by the Event
<em> class constants, this basic information is sufficient. Other events,
</em> however, may require more detailed information. Events associated with a
<em> mouse click, for example, need to include additional information about the
</em> location of the click event and whether any keys were pressed during the
<em> click event. You can pass such additional information to event listeners by
</em> extending the Event class, which is what the MouseEvent class does.
<em> ActionScript 3.0 API defines several Event subclasses for common events
</em> that require additional information. Events associated with each of the
<em> Event subclasses are described in the documentation for each class.</p></td></tr><tr><td width="200"><a href="/neko/flash/events/EventDispatcher.html">EventDispatcher</a></td><td><p>The EventDispatcher class is the base class for all classes that dispatch
<em> events. The EventDispatcher class implements the IEventDispatcher interface
</em> and is the base class for the DisplayObject class. The EventDispatcher
<em> class allows any object on the display list to be an event target and as
</em> such, to use the methods of the IEventDispatcher interface.
<em>
</em> <p>Event targets are an important part of the Flash<sup>®</sup> Player and
<em> Adobe<sup>®</sup> AIR<sup>®</sup> event model. The event target serves as
</em> the focal point for how events flow through the display list hierarchy.
<em> When an event such as a mouse click or a keypress occurs, Flash Player or
</em> the AIR application dispatches an event object into the event flow from the
<em> root of the display list. The event object then makes its way through the
</em> display list until it reaches the event target, at which point it begins
<em> its return trip through the display list. This round-trip journey to the
</em> event target is conceptually divided into three phases: the capture phase
<em> comprises the journey from the root to the last node before the event
</em> target's node, the target phase comprises only the event target node, and
<em> the bubbling phase comprises any subsequent nodes encountered on the return
</em> trip to the root of the display list.</p></td></tr><tr><td width="200"><a href="/neko/flash/events/EventPhase.html">EventPhase</a></td><td><p>The EventPhase class provides values for the <code>eventPhase</code>
* property of the Event class.</p></td></tr><tr><td width="200"><a href="/neko/flash/events/FocusEvent.html">FocusEvent</a></td><td><p>An object dispatches a FocusEvent object when the user changes the focus
<em> from one object in the display list to another. There are four types of
</em> focus events:
<em> <ul>
</em>   <li><code>FocusEvent.FOCUS<em>IN</code></li>
*   <li><code>FocusEvent.FOCUS</em>OUT</code></li>
<em>   <li><code>FocusEvent.KEY<em>FOCUS</em>CHANGE</code></li>
</em>   <li><code>FocusEvent.MOUSE<em>FOCUS</em>CHANGE</code></li>
* </ul></p></td></tr><tr><td width="200"><a href="/neko/flash/events/IEventDispatcher.html">IEventDispatcher</a></td><td><p></p></td></tr><tr><td width="200"><a href="/neko/flash/events/IOErrorEvent.html">IOErrorEvent</a></td><td><p>An IOErrorEvent object is dispatched when an error causes input or output
<em> operations to fail.
</em>
<em> <p>You can check for error events that do not have any listeners by using
</em> the debugger version of Flash Player or the AIR Debug Launcher(ADL). The
<em> string defined by the <code>text</code> parameter of the IOErrorEvent
</em> constructor is displayed.</p></td></tr><tr><td width="200"><a href="/neko/flash/events/KeyboardEvent.html">KeyboardEvent</a></td><td><p>A KeyboardEvent object id dispatched in response to user input through a
<em> keyboard. There are two types of keyboard events:
</em> <code>KeyboardEvent.KEY<em>DOWN</code> and <code>KeyboardEvent.KEY</em>UP</code>
<em>
</em> <p>Because mappings between keys and specific characters vary by device and
<em> operating system, use the TextEvent event type for processing character
</em> input.</p></td></tr><tr><td width="200"><a href="/neko/flash/events/MouseEvent.html">MouseEvent</a></td><td><p>A MouseEvent object is dispatched into the event flow whenever mouse events
<em> occur. A mouse event is usually generated by a user input device, such as a
</em> mouse or a trackball, that uses a pointer.
<em>
</em> <p>When nested nodes are involved, mouse events target the deepest possible
<em> nested node that is visible in the display list. This node is called the
</em> <i>target node</i>. To have a target node's ancestor receive notification
<em> of a mouse event, use <code>EventDispatcher.addEventListener()</code> on
</em> the ancestor node with the <code>type</code> parameter set to the specific
* mouse event you want to detect.</p></td></tr><tr><td width="200"><a href="/neko/flash/events/TextEvent.html">TextEvent</a></td><td><p>An object dispatches a TextEvent object when a user enters text in a text
<em> field or clicks a hyperlink in an HTML-enabled text field. There are two
</em> types of text events: <code>TextEvent.LINK</code> and
* <code>TextEvent.TEXT_INPUT</code>.</p></td></tr><tr><td width="200"><a href="/neko/flash/events/TouchEvent.html">TouchEvent</a></td><td><p>The TouchEvent class lets you handle events on devices that detect user
<em> contact with the device(such as a finger on a touch screen). When a user
</em> interacts with a device such as a mobile phone or tablet with a touch
<em> screen, the user typically touches the screen with his or her fingers or a
</em> pointing device. You can develop applications that respond to basic touch
<em> events(such as a single finger tap) with the TouchEvent class. Create
</em> event listeners using the event types defined in this class. For user
<em> interaction with multiple points of contact(such as several fingers moving
</em> across a touch screen at the same time) use the related GestureEvent,
<em> PressAndTapGestureEvent, and TransformGestureEvent classes. And, use the
</em> properties and methods of these classes to construct event handlers that
<em> respond to the user touching the device.
</em>
<em> <p>Use the Multitouch class to determine the current environment's support
</em> for touch interaction, and to manage the support of touch interaction if
<em> the current environment supports it.</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div></div></body></html>
